}
\arguments{
\item{rxmo}{correlation between X and Mo}

\item{rxy}{correlation between X and Y}

\item{rymo}{correlation between Y and Mo}

\item{nobs}{number of observations in the sample or sample size}

\item{labelest}{label for which estimate the figure is for: a1b1, a1, b1 or c, default is a1b1}

\item{conflevel}{confidence interval level, default is 0.95}

\item{specifyunob}{whether the user wants to specify two unobserved correlations default is 0, meaning no}

\item{rxmu}{correlation between X and Mu}

\item{rmomu}{correlation between Mo and Mu}
}
\value{
plot for how rmomu affects the estimates and confidence interval
}
\description{
give the sensitivity plot for how the correlation between Y and Mu affects the estimates and confidence interval
}
